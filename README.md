## Prerequisites
1. Node
You can install NodeJS [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Please make sure you select the correct(Windows, Mac, Linux). Any version above 10.10 will do. Normally, it detects what OS and architecture you're running.

2. GitBash
We will be using Git for collaboration purposes. Install it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

3. A code editor.
I really suggest using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but using [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) is also good.

4. A GitHub account
Finally, register a github account and follow the steps below to start setting up.

## Installation.
1. Open GitBash. No need to open the GUI. We will just be using the terminal today.
2. Clone this repository by entering this command.
```
git clone https://github.com/johnveeuminga/movie-app
```

3. Navigate to the cloned repository by entering this command(still in GitBash).
```
cd movie-app
```

4. Install Node dependencies by entering this command.
```
npm install
```

## Quick overview of what we're doing
TLDR: We will developing sort of a Netflix homepage clone together using React using modern Web Development concepts.

This app will get data from an external API, [The MovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/). To maximize immersion, I haven't done a complete version of this app. Rather, we will be developing this together. So we need to plan, enumerate requirements, form different teams, give each team a goal, merge everything together etc. The end goal of my talk is to give you guys an experience of how modern web development is done.

I'm going to give you guys a brief introduction of modern software development and web development, then we're going to dive right into React.
